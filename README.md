# Python - Gearworks
A gear generator in python.

# name conflict notice
I was careless  when choosing a name for this project and it was already taken. If you're looking for the older gggears project go check out https://sourceforge.net/projects/gggears/ 

The 2 are unrelated other than the (perhaps poor) choice of name.

Out of respect for the original gggears this project is getting renamed to py-gearworks.

# Installation
Currently the recommended way for most users to install py_gearworks is to install from github directly (git is required on the user's system for this):
```
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/GarryBGoode/gggears
```
Alternatively, one can clone or download this repository and install via this command from the repository root directory:
```
python -m pip install .
```
# Dependencies

py_gearworks CAD model creation uses build123d package: [build123d github](https://github.com/gumyr/build123d)

It is highly recommended, though not strictly necessary to use a python-CAD gui solution.
See [OCP VSCode](https://github.com/bernhard-42/vscode-ocp-cad-viewer) and [CadQuery Editor](https://github.com/CadQuery/CQ-editor).

Work in progress / partially supported:
- Racks

Not yet supported:

- Hypoid gears
- Worm gears
- Face / crown gears

Planned upcoming other features

# Example
The example is built on VSCode with OCP VScode plugin.
See `examples.py` for more.
```python
from py_gearworks import *
from ocp_vscode import show, set_port

# create 2 spur gears
gear1 = SpurGear(number_of_teeth=12)
gear2 = SpurGear(number_of_teeth=23)

# move and align gear 1 next to gear 2 in the Y direction
# backlash can be optionally specified
# angle_bias conrtols location within backlash range (-1 to 1)
gear1.mesh_to(gear2, target_dir=UP, backlash=0.2, angle_bias=1)

# generate build123d Part objects
gear_part_1 = gear1.build_part()
gear_part_2 = gear2.build_part()

# visualize parts
show(gear_part_1, gear_part_2)
```
